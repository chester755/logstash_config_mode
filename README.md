# logstash_config_mode
This is an alternative attempts to create a mode for logstash configuration file
As the logstash-conf-mode is relatively slow when the configure file getting larger.
Basically adapted the derived-mode and need a bit configuration before it can be used.
Performance wise I think it is very good.
